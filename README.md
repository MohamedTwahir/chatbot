Hello, and welcome to my  Chatbot! This program was  inspired  by Kapilesh Pennichetty and Sanjay Balasubramanian. Through user interaction, it can do the following:

    * Retrieve the summary of a Wikipedia article
    * Find the weather of any location, automatically by finding the user's location using their external IP address*, or manually by prompting the user to enter a city
    * Play an Interactive Story, where the user decides how the character responds to different scenarios
*Please note that if you are going to use the automatic IP address function, you must run it on a local machine for accurate results. This is because the program needs your IP address to accurately find your location, and then it uses your location to retrieve the weather. Also, please disable your VPN or Internet Proxy for accurate results.
It is a python program which will need python 3.9 or later version for it to run.
For you to run it on a local machine you must install all  the necessary dependancies like:
    1. Wikipedia API
    2. PyOWM
    3. IPStack for Python(A Geolocation Library)
